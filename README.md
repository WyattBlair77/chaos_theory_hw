drawing bifurcation diagrams

Zooming into the naturally occurring bifurcation diagram from iteration of the function f(x, r )= r*x*(1-x).
You can plug in any function of r and x here and see how the stability changes across an arbitrary range of both r and x.
The diagram it is currently set to generate is where we get the Feigenbaum Constant, an irrational number like pi, which
helps describe how often the period "doubles" here.

Note how the x and r axes are zooming further into the pictures successively and the structure "repeats" itself over and over again
"flipping" upside down each time.
